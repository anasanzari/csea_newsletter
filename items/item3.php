                <p>As college students, we all know how important internships are in shaping our careers. I remember my classmates running around trying to get letters of recommendation as early as at the beginning of the third semester. Although an internship after the third year of BTech is an absolute must for both getting a good job after graduation and for applying for higher studies, an internship after the second year helps boost oneâ€™s profile for graduate school applications more than job applications.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of internship opportunities available for Computer Science students with the increase in the number of tech companies and research programs at various universities within and outside India. I am going to talk exclusively about research-based internships here, because I know better about them through first-hand experience. CSEA does a really good job at spreading awareness about these through the annual internship talk, but something I found slightly disappointing was that very few people actually apply to these programs to avail of these remarkable opportunities.</p>
                <p>In my conversations with fellow classmates and juniors, I found that most of them felt that they were not qualified enough for the internship programs, especially those outside India, and so they did not apply. Through this article, I would like to encourage all the current students to apply to these opportunities. You will never know until you actually apply. It is all about demand and supply. Perhaps you have something they are looking for, but if you do not apply in the first place, you will never get it. It is like a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
                <p>I know this because when I was applying for research internships at universities outside India in my third year, I was very confident that I would not get into any of them. That was mainly because I had heard so much about the IIT bias and also the fact that I had no prior research experience. I felt like it was a vicious cycle: you need research experience to get a research internship and you need the latter for the former too, but as it turned out, this was not the case. I got accepted into a lot of programs, leaving me completely surprised (pleasantly).</p>

                <p>I am not saying that you do not need a good profile to get accepted, but I knew people who had good profiles and yet did not apply. I would like to encourage you to not be one such person. If you are still in your first or second year, you have a lot of time to work on your profile. The easiest way is to complete online courses in your area of interest within Computer Science. There are multiple options available now: Coursera, Udacity and edX among others. Completing such courses and doing some project work shows that you are motivated and focused, which is something people look for when they review internship applications.</p>
                  <p>But is it really worth the effort to apply to these programs? Filling up long forms and getting the required supporting documents from college is in fact very time-consuming. I think it is totally worth it. Through my internship, I got to learn a lot of new things. It also helped me develop skills in working on my own and as a team. I learned how to look at a problem from different perspectives to come up with novel solutions. These internships also come with a huge benefit of research-related letters of recommendation, which is a big plus for graduate school applications, especially if you are applying for a PhD. This, again, is from my first-hand experience.</p>
                  <p>I know that a lot of you reading this article have not even thought about higher studies, but I see it as a way of keeping that door open. It will only add plus points to your profile, and who knows, maybe the internship will motivate you to pursue higher education. Personally, I had never thought of doing a PhD, but during my internship, I enjoyed research so much that I started applying for graduate school programs as soon as I came back.</p>
                  <p>All in all, I hope I was successful in somewhat demystifying research-based internships and encouraging you to at least consider applying. I found the website www.internshala.com very helpful in finding information about these programs and I urge you to visit it. Good luck!</p>
