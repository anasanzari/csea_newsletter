        <p>Every mathematician or a computer scientist would have dreamt of reaching great heights as far as those scaled by Mr. Alan Turing.
        This man, a brilliant mathematician, logistician and cryptanalyst, needs no further introduction.
        His contribution to the field of theoretical computer science shaped this field as we see it today.
        The first issue of the official newsletter of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,
        NIT Calicut pays homage to him. The machine, named after its inventor, is a simple yet a highly powerful mathematical model
         used to simulate the logic of any algorithm.</p>
