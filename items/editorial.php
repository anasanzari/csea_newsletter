              <p>“Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.” </p>
              <p>Every mathematician or a computer scientist would have dreamt of reaching great heights as high as those scaled by Mr. Alan Turing. This man, a brilliant mathematician, logistician and cryptanalyst, needs no further introduction. His contribution to the field of theoretical computer science shaped this field as we see it today.</p>
              <p>The first issue of the official newsletter of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, NIT Calicut pays homage to him. The machine, named after its inventor, is a simple yet a highly powerful mathematical model used to simulate the logic of any algorithm. </p>
              <p>This newsletter, aptly named Threads, refers not only to its relevance in the field of Operating Systems but also to the fact that it is the little things are often the most important.</p>

              <p>The purpose of this newsletter is to share knowledge, tit bits and updates from the ever-changing CS scenario. This newsletter will feature articles from our current students, alumni, updates from the Free and Open Source community apart from an informal section for our coders and hackers to take lighthearted breaks after their long hours at work. This issue came into light only due to the creativity and toil of several students who put in their best effort. </p>
              <p>My heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Vinod Pathari sir, Staff Editor without whom this would have not been possible. My sincere thanks to the Head of the Department, Dr. K. A Abdul Nazeer and to the CSEA faculty incharges, Dr. S. D. Madhukumar and Ms. A. Lijiya for their support. </p>
              <p>Happy Reading!<br><em>Aishwarya, Student Editor, Threads</em></p>
