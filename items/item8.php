                  <h4>Steven Deobald - The Worst Programmer I ever met</h4>
                  <p>
Relationships are hard. Software is hard. FOSS communities often represent the most difficult intersection of these two axes.
Attendees will come out with practical lessons and tools for working in teams, bettering themselves, and avoiding some of softwareâ€™s most expensive mistakes.

                  <p>
                      We all use keyboards. And not all of us care enough about them to ensure that, like our operating systems, they are hackable too. What could be better than to
                      build your own keyboard using open hardware designs and components and then program it using free / open source software?
