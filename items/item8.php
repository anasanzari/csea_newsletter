                  <h4>The Worst Programmer I ever met - Steven Deobald</h4>
                  <p>
Relationships are hard. Software is hard. FOSS communities often represent the most difficult intersection of these two axes.
Attendees will come out with practical lessons and tools for working in teams, bettering themselves, and avoiding some of software’s most expensive mistakes.

                  <h4>Golang Workshop - Baiju M</h4>
                  <p>
                      This workshop taught the fundamentals of Go programming language. The workshop included setting up environment for Go development, basic syntax, concepts and solving few problems.

                  <h4>Building your own Hackable Keyboard - Abhas Abhinav</h4>
                  <p>
                      We all use keyboards. And not all of us care enough about them to ensure that, like our operating systems, they are hackable too. What could be better than to
                      build your own keyboard using open hardware designs and components and then program it using free / open source software?
                  </p><br>
                  <h4>Contributing to the Linux kernel - Tapaswini Pathak and Vaishali Thakkar</h4>
                  <p>
                      Nothing screams open source like the Linux kernel spread out over millions of devices across the globe. This workshop was a good first step in learning to
                      contribute to the same.
